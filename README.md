# Java Functional
This project is part of my effort to master functional style in Java. It follows the following articles:

* [Lambdas are not functional programming](https://medium.com/@johnmcclean/lambdas-are-not-functional-programming-63533ce2eb74)
* [A functional approach to dependency injection in Java](https://medium.com/hackernoon/superkleisliisfantasticframeworksareatrocious-a-functional-approach-to-dependency-injection-in-e7bc8c4993fa)

My biggest goal with this initiative is to get very comfortable with functional composition, being able to think functional when structuring my classes and methods.

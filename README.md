# Spring Batch
This is my first Spring Batch project. It was built following along with Plural Sight's training course [Getting Started with Spring Batch 4](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-spring-batch/table-of-contents). The instructor GitHub repo is [HERE](https://github.com/michaelhoffmantech/patient-batch-loader).
